## Overview

Machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.



## Summary

As part of a personal project, my partners and I decided to engage in this Kaggle´s competition.  We had a bit of experience with NLP and we all wanted to learn a bit more so we decided to  take this challenge.

**There is no doubt that this project can be done individually but through the time we have learnt that by working together we can get better results and learn some cool programming tips and tricks from each other.** **And of course, this is how real life works.**



## Process followed

1. Data exploration.
2. Data cleaning with Python, Pandas and Regex.
3. Checked correct spelling and valid words.
4. Tokenization
5. Lemmatization
6. Vectorize data and remove stop words
7. Explored different ML supervised classification models using Sklearn.
8. Modified hyperparameters to implement Grid Searching and H2o in order to improve the model.



## Results

So far, after trying different ML models, we obtained an accuracy of **.80232** through a Support Vector Machine model, which is not bad for a NLP model but can definitely still be improved.



## Future steps

- [ ] Explore and implement deep learning models for NLP to improve our accuracy score.



## Tools
